## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CUBE CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was great to get more hands-on practice with grid. I have a preference for flexbox since I'm more comfortable with it. So doing more projects focusing on grid will help me choose the best tool for the job.

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid the easy way by Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/rg7Fvvl3taU?si=liH24ae8u_IqcsaQ) - This helped me better understand the basics of CSS grid. It was also very useful to see how a professional would tackle this challenge.
